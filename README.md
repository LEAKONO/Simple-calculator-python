1. # Simple Calculator üßÆ
- A simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input. This project demonstrates the use of functions, conditional statements, and user interaction in Python.

2. ## Features ‚ú®
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
3. ## How to Use üñ•Ô∏è
Clone or Download the Repository
If the project is hosted on GitHub, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/LEAKONO/Simple-calculator-python.git'
cd calculator
```

4. ## Run the Program
Open a terminal and run the Python script:

``` bash
python calculator.py
```
Input Numbers and Operation
The program will prompt you to:

Enter two numbers
Select an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /)
Get the Result
The program will display the result of the operation.


5. ###  Code Overview üìù
The main function in the script:

def calculator(num1, num2, operation):
    if operation == '+':
        return num1 + num2
    elif operation == '-':
        return num1 - num2
    elif operation == '*':
        return num1 * num2
    elif operation == '/':
        return num1 / num2
    else:
        return "Invalid operation!"


6. ## Future Improvements üöÄ
Add support for additional operations (e.g., modulo, exponentiation).
Include input validation to handle invalid numbers or operations.
Create a user-friendly GUI for the calculator.

7. ## License üìú
